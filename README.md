# KaguraClient-V1-Source
The source code of my first KaguraClient SPRX for Minecraft PS3
# Made By aMsk & AzeY

Make what you want with this source and have fun!
Remember the only one rule its credits the original creator, thx in advance ^^

# How to use and build ?

Very Easy. Install on your PC the PS3 SDK latest version available, ProDG and Visual Studio Pro 2013.
I recommend have a 8gb of ram and 15go available on your system.
And in Visual Studio just press Build.
PS: When you build a SPRX its make for CFW user so if you need resign it for HEN, use Aldo's Tools.

# If you have any problem don't disturb me, if you know how to make a sprx make it, if not don't make.
